#### 1. Stripe Atlas

[Original link] (https://stripe.com/atlas) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11166417) (1643 points, 388 comments, author [hepha1979](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hepha1979) has 4432 karma at time of writing)

**TL;DR:**

Stripe, a payment startup, introduces Atlas, a new way to start an business from anywhere in the world, by incorporating in the United States, setting up a US bank account, getting tax and legal guidance, and optionally start accepting payments with Stripe.

The idea is that by using Atlas, these operations are as much automated as possible, making them less time consuming and less expensive.

This initiative aims to lower the typical geographic barriers that you have when trying to do such a thing.

The service will be free for the first 100 users, and after that the beta access will cost 500 USD, which includes all fees.

You will also get access to services from PwC or Orrick (global accounting/tax firms), and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides 15,000 USD in credits.

The process, instead of the usual few months, takes only a few days.

You can request access from the site, and read a detailed FAQ section.

**TL;DR:**

Apple is refusing to comply with a court order to unlock an iPhone recently used by a terrorist, considering this request an attack to the privacy of millions of people.

Microsoft will file an "amicus brief" (if you are an expert in a field in which someone else is currently involved, you can offer your point of view to influence the verdict) next week to support Apple. Google, Facebook and Twitter are expected to take similar actions.

Microsoft says it's important to help fight terrorism, but it's unfair to ask companies to build backdoors in their products.

Bill Gates was reported to fully support the Government's request, but he told Bloomberg TV that his opinion was not accurately reported.

#### 3. Microsoft acquires Xamarin

[Original link] (http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/welcoming-the-xamarin-team-to-microsoft) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11169215) (1122 points, 379 comments, author [legomaster] (https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=legomaster) has 519 karma points)

**TL;DR:**

Mobile devices are growing in importance, and Microsoft is focusing on it, hence the acquisition of Xamarin, a platform that leverages .NET to develop mobile apps in C# and offer native apps to Windows, Android and iOS devices while using the same code base.

Xamarin has more than 15,000 customers, such as Alaska Airlines, Coca-Cola Bottling, Thermo Fisher, Honeywell, JetBlue, and gaming companies like SuperGiant Games and Gummy Drop.

Xamarin Test Cloud allows C#, Objective-C, Java apps to be tested on thousands of mobile devices.
 
Microsoft have partnered with Xamarin to integrate it into Visual Studio, Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Enterprise Mobility Suite, and offer training and tools.

This acquisition will reinforce this partnership.

The integrated solution will allow a developer to develop, test and deliver apps for any device.

More information will be available at the Microsoft //Build conference in a few weeks, and Xamarin Evolve conference.

#### 4. Justice Department Wants Apple to Unlock Nine More iPhones

[Original link] (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/technology/justice-department-wants-apple-to-unlock-nine-more-iphones.html) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11164107) (635 points, 303 comments, author [jstreebin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jstreebin) has 1735 karma at time of writing)

Reading time for original: 6 minutes

**TL;DR:**

The Justice Department, using the 1789 "All Writs Act", is asking Apple's help to unlock nine other iPhones, in addition to the one used by a terrorist, Syed Rizwan Farook, involved in the San Bernardino attack where 14 people were killed. Apple fears that helping in the San Bernardino case will be a precedent to use the backdoor many more times, and wants to resist in at least seven of these cases.

Apple has handed over data to comply with a court order when technically able to do so. In the first half of 2015, 11,000 requests for information on 60,000 devices have resulted in the sharing of data in 7,100 instances, mostly from iCloud accounts.

Some of these requests might include drug trafficking and pornography.

In one case, despite the iPhone owner pleaded guilty, prosecutors still want the phone unlocked as it might lead to other drug traffickers; the decision is pending and, even if this case seems less important than the San Bernardino one, it can shed light on the Government ability to leverage the "All Writs Act" and influence other cases, and/or become significant case law.

Some NYC police officers have collected 175 phones that they've been unable to unlock so far. One of them, Mr. Vance, said that these cases are important as they can lead to other criminal activites.

#### 5. Dear Skype/Microsoft: Problems with Linux client

[Original link] (http://nickforall.nl/skype/) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11165568) (820 points, 461 comments, author [cujanovic] (https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cujanovic) has 781 karma at time of writing)

Reading time for original: 2 minutes

**TL;DR:**

Using Skype on Linux has been painful since the Microsoft acquisition, but from February 22, 2016, the Linux client is unable to join calls, probably because the client has not been updated for three years, ignoring any tweet to @SkypeSupport.

It is disgraceful that Skype did that before any alternatives are available, without telling users.

We understand that Linux is seen as a competitor, but we do not understand why this results in a lack of support for Skype. Linux users might prefer not to use Windows, but some of them are paying business customers of Skype.

Signed by "Lots of angry Linux users".

You can support this complaint by tweeting a link on the page.

#### 6. Apple Is Said to Be Working on an iPhone Even It Canâ€™t Hack

[Original link] (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/technology/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-an-iphone-even-it-cant-hack.html) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11171131) (618 points, 399 comments, author [rquantz] (https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rquantz) has 2039 karma at time of writing)

Reading time for original: 6 minutes

**TL;DR:**

Apple is working on new security measures to protect iPhones from being broken into, as in the current court fight in California.

If successful, it would make almost useless to demand Apple to unlock iPhones.

To avoid an arms race, experts say Congress should be involved, as Federal wiretapping laws don't apply to Apple or Google.

After Snowden's revelations, tech companies have started to build defenses against government intrusions.

A greater security also helps Apple reassure investors and customers.

In a letter by Apple's CEO Tim Cook, he reassures customers that their data is out of even Apple's reach; however, a built-in troubleshooting system allows for a possible security update involving the phone's firmware, without requiring a password, and the FBI would like to use that to remove security features from the terrorist's phone and make it easier to break into it, but also into many other phones.

Different people, under anonymity, suggest different possible security options for Apple to fix this vulnerability.

This "bug" notification came in the form of a court order.

Apple is following a Silicon Valley trend of tightened security (after Google, Yahoo!), after Snowden's revelations. In this case, Apple consider itself part of the vulnerability.

The FBI minimizes the importance of this request.

Apple instead thinks that this will set a precedent to force companies to comply for even more dangerous requests.

The Obama administration's stance forces the Justice Department to fight in each case like this.

Apple's challenge is to find a security solution that doesn't compromise the ease of use, such as when retrieving photos and data from iCloud.

#### 7. Spotify moves its back end to Google Cloud 

[Original link] (https://news.spotify.com/us/2016/02/23/announcing-spotify-infrastructures-googley-future/) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11159840) (713 points, 381 comments, author [dmichel] (https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dmichel) has 324 karma at time of writing)

**TL;DR:**

Even if Spotify is a music company, today's announcement is about its technical infrastructure and its move to Google Cloud Platform.

Since the streaming experience is important, Spotify has used data centers close to its customers, but this is more and more difficult in a growing business.

For a while we did it ourselves, but now the quality offered by cloud providers is higher than ever, and our pick, Google, seems to have the edge.

The experience with Google's platform and tools was the tipping event.

We happily use Dataproc, Pub/Sub and BigQuery.

Our complex backend means that this move will require some time.

We will share our experience as we go.

#### 8. No patent if invention lies only in computer program, says Indian Patent Office

[Original link] (http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/no-patent-if-invention-lies-only-in-computer-programme-says-indian-patent-office-116022200875_1.html) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11158300) (588 points, 180 comments, author [joshsharp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=joshsharp) has 1361 karma at time of writing)

Reading time for original: 3 minutes

**TL;DR:**

The Indian Patent Office's new guideline is that patent applications for Computer Related Inventions (CRI) should be denied if the invention lays only in mathematical method, business method or algorithm; this changes a previous ruling in August 2015, criticized by "The Software Freedom Law Centre" (SFLC), and affects Section 3(K) of the Patents Act 1970.

The aim is to bring in uniformity and consistency in examination of CRI patent applications.

The previous guideline could have resulted in a flood of patents being granted in the field of software, which would affect the Indian IT industry and startups.

#### 9. German government to use Trojan spyware to monitor citizens

[Original link] (http://www.dw.com/en/german-government-to-use-trojan-spyware-to-monitor-citizens/a-19066629) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11158796) (519 points, 185comments, author [temp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=temp) has 2066 karma at time of writing)

Reading time for original: 2 minutes

**TL;DR:**

The German government has approved the use of "Trojans"/malware to monitor the computers and smartphones of suspected citizens, only when backed by a court order.

Konstantin von Notz, member of the Green party, protested by saying that even if they understand the needs, means don't justify the end in a lawful country.

The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) thinks that these tools are too powerful and should be toned down.

According to a 2008 decision by the German Constitutional Court, remote access to a citizen's computer is permissible only if there is life-threatening danger or suspicion of criminal activity against the state.

#### 10. Windows Now Showing Full-Screen Ads

[Original link] (http://www.howtogeek.com/243263/how-to-disable-ads-on-your-windows-10-lock-screen/) - [HN Link] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11167964) (592 points, 357 comments, author [tasoeur](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tasoeur) has 605 karma at time of writing)

Reading time for original: 2 minutes

**TL;DR:**

On Windows 10, when you unlock your screen you might see an ad, enabled by the "Windows spotlight" feature in your personalization settings.

You can turn it off by opening the settings app, choose personalization settings, then Lock screen tab, deselect Windows Spotlight in favor of picture of slideshow.

This will disable Microsoft from automatically pushing ads.

You can also disable "Get fun facts, tips, tricks, and more on your lock screen" to avoid unexpected sales pitches for games.

If the ads don't annoy you, you can instead tell Microsoft which ones are relevant.
